#Golf Game
A more advanced version of Simple_Golf_Game that uses functions.

##Reflection
###Changes
- Replaced any constants with global variables where appropriate.
- Replaced any numbers in functions to local variables where appropriate.
- Added handling of both upper and lower case inputs with the .lower() function.
- Used syntax “+=” to add variables to themselves instead of writing the variable twice. 
- Used the enumerate function to get the index and index value from a list at the same time.

##Challenges
Dealing with the putter at 1m from the hole. I had introduced an infinite loop. This was fixed by including an if 
statement removing the possibility of the shot being calculated at 1m.


Integrating a list into the code to keep the players score and par for each hole they played.

##Extension
One extension that could be added to the game would be a variation in holes. Then the player doesnt have to 
play the same hole every time. This could be done by randomising hole distance and par each time. 
Then keeping track of each new hole’s distances and par in the players final score as well as the players shots taken. 
This could generate up to 18 different holes to better emulate a real game of golf or play an arcade 
mode with infinite holes. 

##Overall Experience
Overall, I found getting the code to do what I what extremely satisfying. I found learning the python syntax 
very rewarding and I am keen to continue growing my knowledge. Regarding the assignment content, golf is a 
boring game so luckily python is interesting to learn and the assignment encompassed a wide range of functions 
that gave a good introduction to how powerful python is. I learned that there are always ways to make your code 
more efficient and it takes many iterations to get to the final finished product. To conclude I found coding this 
assignment enjoyable and look forward to more challenges.
